This project is a web-based application that classifies images into one of ten categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the dataset to provide accurate predictions. The application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Project Overview
The web app allows users to upload an image, which is then processed by the trained CNN model. The model predicts the category of the image and displays the result along with the confidence score.

Features
Image classification into ten predefined categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
A trained CNN model for high accuracy.
User-friendly interface with a simple image upload system.
Flask-based backend for processing user requests.
Interactive frontend with responsive design.
Display of confidence scores for predictions.
Project Structure
The project consists of multiple components, including:

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive user interface.
Backend: A Flask application that loads the trained model and handles predictions.
Model: A pre-trained CNN model that has been saved and is used for classification.
Static Files: Includes CSS and JavaScript for UI enhancements.
Uploads Folder: Stores the images uploaded by users for classification.
Installation and Usage
To run this project, the necessary dependencies must be installed. The Flask server handles requests, and the trained model is used for making predictions. Users can upload an image through the web interface and receive a classification result in real time.

Deployment
This project can be deployed on cloud platforms like Render or Heroku. The necessary configurations, such as environment settings and dependencies, must be provided for smooth deployment.

Future Improvements
Implementing a drag-and-drop image upload feature.
Enhancing the UI with better animations and visual feedback.
Optimizing the model for faster predictions.
Extending support for additional datasets and categories.
Converting the web app into a mobile-friendly version using Flutter or React Native.
